# CSS Live Tutorial
The first time we encounter responsiveness, it can seem like a real monster. But in reality, itâ€™s more like a family that, when unorganized, turns into a big mess.

One magical and fundamental rule I learned when applying responsiveness to projects is that, just like in a family, the rules are set by the parents. In other words, responsiveness should always start with the main container. This tip was essential for me! Since I focus more on Back-End development, every time I need to create layouts, I end up referring to the documentation. And as we all know, documentation can be extensive and take a lot of time to find the right attribute for the task at hand.

With that in mind, I decided to create an application that presents the main attributes and properties in a summarized way, with the added bonus of a live visual preview. For now, the application is available in both Portuguese and English, but I welcome contributions from anyone interested in translating it into other languages or helping with development.
